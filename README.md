# EE485-Senior Design Project-Modular_Synth
This is the Senior Design project done by David Castro and Eric Burgess at CSUF in the fall semester of 2021 (August 2021 - December 2021) on building an Analog Modular Synthesizer

A video of the behavior of the Modular synthesizer can be seen on Eric Burgess's (partner) youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhq_Q-R4t1U

The report, presentation, and virtual poster for a summary of the probject are also posted on this repository:

- Presentation: https://github.com/EEdavidcastro/EE485-SeniorDesign-Modular_Synth/blob/main/485Final%20Presentation_DavidCastro_EricBurgess.pdf

Note about uploaded files in the circuit design:
  - KiCad files for pcb design
  - .ms14 files are CAD files done in multisim software to show simulation

Note on file labeling mistake:
- Current Source file has files inside named VCF, ignore the title/label of it being VCF, they are the current source files



Note about Midi Design: <br>
  The current MIDI instrument is a modified version of Elkayem’s midi2cv design done by a youtuber named
“Benny Bones.” In references, the github repository that provides the gerber files and code to run
the MIDI is provided.
